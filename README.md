# Expo Camera and ImageManipulator API: Intermittent Errors during Image Processing

This repository demonstrates a bug encountered when using the Expo `Camera` and `ImageManipulator` APIs for custom image processing. The issue manifests as intermittent errors or unexpected results when accessing pixel data from images captured using the camera.

## Bug Description

The problem arises when attempting to perform manipulations on images obtained from the Expo Camera API, particularly when using `ImageManipulator.manipulateAsync` to access pixel data for custom processing.  The error is not consistent and difficult to reliably reproduce.  This inconsistency makes debugging and resolving the issue challenging.

## Steps to Reproduce

1. Clone this repository.
2. Run the app using Expo CLI (`expo start`).
3. Capture an image using the Camera component.
4. Observe if the image processing step completes successfully, or whether it fails with an error or produces unexpected output.

## Solution

The provided solution attempts to address the problem by implementing more robust error handling and image manipulation strategies.  It also includes alternative solutions for specific error cases, such as potential memory issues.
